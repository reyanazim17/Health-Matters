            <h4>1st of all, you will be needing a healthy diet.. confused how you gonna get it? well, I'm here to show
                you how</h4>
            <p>This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of
                food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.

                This page covers healthy eating advice for the general population.

                People with special dietary needs or a medical condition should ask their doctor or a registered
                dietitian for advice.</p>

        <section class="begin">
        <div ><img src="images/food.jpg" alt=""></div><p class="pop">The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.

            If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.
            
            You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.
            
            It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).
            
            Most adults in the UK are eating more calories than they need and should eat fewer calories.</p></section>
